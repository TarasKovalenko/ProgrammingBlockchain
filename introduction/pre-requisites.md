## Prerequisites {#pre-requisites}

### Skills {#skills}

*   You need to be comfortable with object oriented as well as functional programming.
*   A basic grasp of C# is helpful, but we feel the code will be legible to developers familiar with Java and other C-based languages.
*   No mathematical knowledge is required. We will not cover cryptography beyond the bare minimum you need to know to make a secure service.
*   You donâ€™t need to have deep knowledge of Bitcoin.

### Tools {#tools}

*   [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/) on Windows or [Xamarin Studio](https://store.xamarin.com)/[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) on Mac and Linux (both free).
*   [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/) - Ideally you have it, but you can just proceed without it.

> **Tip:** If disk space is an issue, consider running Bitcoin Core in pruning mode. It is practically the same as a full node (including security), except it throws away some of the old history.
